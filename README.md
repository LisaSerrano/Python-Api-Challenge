# Pymaceuticals, Inc. - Anti-Cancer Medication Study Report

## Background
Welcome to Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing anti-cancer medications. In this assignment, you've been given access to data from a recent animal study focusing on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors receiving various drug regimens, including Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin.

## Instructions
This assignment consists of several tasks aimed at analyzing the study data and generating essential tables and figures for a technical report. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

### 1. Prepare the Data
- Merge the mouse metadata and study results DataFrames.
- Check for duplicate mouse IDs and remove any duplicate data.
- Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

### 2. Generate Summary Statistics
- Create summary statistics for each drug regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume.

### 3. Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
- Generate bar charts showing the total number of rows (mouse ID/timepoints) for each drug regimen.
- Create pie charts displaying the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

### 4. Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
- Determine the final tumor volume of each mouse for four promising treatment regimens.
- Calculate quartiles, IQR, and identify potential outliers.
- Generate a box plot to visualize the distribution of final tumor volume across treatment groups.

### 5. Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
- Plot tumor volume versus time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin.
- Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

### 6. Calculate Correlation and Regression
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
- Plot the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot.

## Observations
Provide a top-level summary of the study results, highlighting key findings and insights gleaned from the analysis.

By completing these tasks, you'll provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma, aiding in decision-making processes for further research and development.
